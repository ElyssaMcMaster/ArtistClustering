# IFAC

This repo will attempt to sort Jacopo di Cione and Niccolo di Pietro Gerini's work and draw conclusions about Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci's contributions to trecento manuscript illuminations. The datasets will include images attributed to Jacopo, Niccolo, and Don Silvestro, and will allow the computer to blindly sort these images using the patterns it sees.
